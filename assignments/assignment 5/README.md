# Assignment 5 - Evaluating environmental impact of your exam portfolio

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the analysis of the environmental impact of code used in previous assignments in the Language Analytics course. We use CodeCarbon to measure CO₂ emissions generated by the scripts and present the results in terms of CO₂-equivalent (CO₂eq) emissions.

### Assignment Objective
The objective of this assignment is to find:
- Which assignment generated the most emissions in terms of CO₂eq? Explain why this might be.
- Which specific tasks generated the most emissions in terms of CO₂eq? Again, explain why this might be.
- How robust do you think these results are and how/where might they be improved?
  
## Steps for running the analysis

### Running the Analysis
1. **Install the requirements:**
    ```bash
    bash setup.sh
    ```
2. **Run the notebook for analysis and visualization:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
    ```

### Summary of the results
The results of the analysis are presented in the notebook found in the `in` folder. Below is a summary of key findings:

**Emissions from all of the assignments**
- **Assignment 1:** 2.19g CO₂eq
- **Assignment 2:** 0.45g CO₂eq
- **Assignment 3:** 0.03g CO₂eq
- **Assignment 4:** 26.56g CO₂eq

**Total emissions for all assignments combined**
**Total:** 29.23g CO₂eq
